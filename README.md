<h1>Hey ! I'm Bruno</h1>

<p>
I'm a Front-End and Back-End developer, designer and python
programmer. I can consider myself a prudent person, knowing the
risks before defining my actions. In areas such as logistics or
production, for example, I can work with methodologies that allow
me to anticipate scenarios and avoid problems, which will probably
be comfortable for me. In these areas I can highlight myself by my
organization characteristics, process vision and cooperative
profile. For me the mistake is a learning, I work a lot to know
how to deal with them.
