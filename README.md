<h1>Hey! I'm Bruno</h1>

<p>
I am a Salesforce Developer and FullStack Developer with 4 years of experience in the field. I have been working on various projects involving ReactJS, TypeScript, and NextJS, constantly seeking to enhance my knowledge. My expertise includes ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, and JavaScript ES6, and I always prioritize best practices, testing, and security in my projects!

I can consider myself a prudent person, knowing the
risks before defining my actions. In areas such as logistics or
production, for example, I can work with methodologies that allow
me to anticipate scenarios and avoid problems, which will probably
be comfortable for me. In these areas I can highlight myself by my
organization characteristics, process vision and cooperative
profile. For me the mistake is a learning, I work a lot to know
how to deal with them.
